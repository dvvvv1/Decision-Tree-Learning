# DecisionTreeLearning
## Algorithms ##
 * Decision Tree
 * Gain Calculation
 * Pivot Split

## Prerequisite ##
Make sure to run this program on Linux.
Make sure ANT is installed on your computer.

## Error Handler 01 ##
If your terminal shows the error message like 'can't find ant command'
Please install Ant.

## Error Handler 02 ##
If you use an IDE such as Eclipse, you can directly copy all files and folders
into your target project folder, and refresh the project view in Eclipse.


## Instructions ##

1. Open the terminal

2. cd to Decision-Tree-Learning/

3. Type "ant" in the terminal to compile all files

4. Type "ant DecisionTreeLearning" in the terminal to run the program

5. Prediction Results will be shown in the terminal. 

6. Algorithms and parameters can be changed in the config file (e.g., "~/Decision-Tree-Learning/config") 

7. "~/Decision-Tree-Learning/train" contains all training data.

8. "~/Decision-Tree-Learning/test" contains all test data.
